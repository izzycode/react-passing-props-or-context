# Different ways of passing props in React

There are many different ways to pass values from a parent container into descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) This program covers some of them.

To see different examples checkout the corresponding branch.

## Branches
- master (empty boilerplate)
- classes-state (class components and props)
- classes-context (class components and context)
- hooks and context (pure functional components and hooks for state and context)

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `git fetch --all` This will download all the branches that are in Github  
  You won't see the branches locally if you do `git branch`  
3. Checkout the desired branch (e.g.: `git checkout classes-state`) and you should get a message that you are now in `classes-state` branch tracking the remote branch of the same name.
